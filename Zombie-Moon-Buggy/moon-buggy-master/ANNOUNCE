        Announcement for Moon-buggy version 1.0
        =======================================

I'm proud to announce the release of Moon-buggy version 1.0.

Moon-buggy is a simple character graphics game where you drive some
kind of car across the moon's surface.  Unfortunately there are
dangerous craters there.  Fortunately your car can jump over them!

Version 1.0 features new animations donated by Piotr Grzybowski and
fixes some minor bugs.

The program is supposed to compile and run on any POSIX compliant
system which provides the curses library but at the moment it is only
tested on GNU/Linux systems.

Moon-buggy is free software and you can download it from the
Moon-buggy download page at <http://seehuhn.de/comp/moon-buggy.html>.
